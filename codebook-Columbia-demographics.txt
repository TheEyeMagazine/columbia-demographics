Summary of Notes:

	From 1996 to 2010, an "Other" category - sometimes explicitly specifying inclusion of bi- or multi-racial students - was used instead of the category of "Two or more." This dataset counts this "Other" category as "Two or more." 

From 2010 to 2017, a "Native Hawaiian" category was used. This dataset includes this category under "Native". 

        For 1996, the "Unknown" category includes non-resident aliens. 
        For 1998, all numbers include non-resident aliens.
        For 1999, exact numbers are not available. All percentages from CC and SEAS include non-resident aliens.
        For 2000, all numbers include non-resident aliens.
